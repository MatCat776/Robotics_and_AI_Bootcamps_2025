## About
The 2025 Robotics and AI Bootcamps will take place June 9-13th, 2025. They are designed for adults ages 18+. All will be offered in-person in the Hedlund Building (2nd floor) on the North Idaho College campus in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Topics covered include Robotics, Embedded Systems, Data Science, and AI. Workshops will take place 9am-5pm in 2 or 4 hour blocks, with a break for (free!) lunch each day. Space is limited, so register early! You need not register for all days or all workshops on each day - feel free to attend those most interesting to you. 

*All workshops require a laptop computer. If you do not have a laptop, please contact us ASAP to see if there is one available for use*

*No prior programming experience required. However, many workshops will operate under the assumption that a python programming environment is installed - if you do not already have one set up, consider coming to the first workshop on Day 1 so we can help you do so.*

*Please note in the registration if you plan to attend any of the workshops only via Zoom. A zoom link will be emailed to the email address provided in the form.* 

*Zoom is not available for all workshops. Most workshops with a physical lab component do not have a zoom session.*
