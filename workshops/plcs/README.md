# Programming a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
June 2025 
Using the Arduino Opta PLC Tutorials

## Download the Arduino PLC IDE
You will probably have to make a (free) account with Arduino to access the tutorial materials

[Download the Arduino PLC IDE from here.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#arduino-plc-ide) I believe it only supports a Windows computer. 

It takes a while to download! 

## Background and History on PLCs
Lecture

## Kit Unpacking and Basic Ladder Logic Diagram

We are just working on the basic LED program. We will not be wiring up the input/output board at all. 

Connection troubleshooting - potentially port issues. 

## Wiring the Input Board to the PLC
Needs:
- Wire Cutters
- Wire Strippers
- PLC Kit
- Screwdriver sets 

[Follow Wiring Guide Here](https://courses.arduino.cc/explore-plc/lessons/getting-started-din-simul8/)

## More Programs 
- RS Latch
- Timer
- If time, structured text

Programs in "project_files" will need to be linked separately.
