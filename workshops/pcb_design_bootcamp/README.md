# PCB Design Bootcamp 

In this bootcamp, we will be designing a printed circuit board. In the following bootcamp, we will learn to solder by using the board we designed. 

## Curriculum and Guide 
This bootcamp is a little different than the others in that we will be using existing curriculum, created by Ã˜yvind Nydal Dahl. He wrote an absolutely fantastic guide that we will be following very closely. I recommend downloading his guide to [follow along with here](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/printed-circuit-board-guide-beginners/) (there is an option to download the guide if you scroll down the page a bit)

We will be following this guide very closely. 

## Download KiCad
To complete this workshop, you will need to download KiCad. You can do that on practically any operating system, thankfully! [Download KiCad Here](https://www.kicad.org/download/). You will want a very recent versions as small of the others ones do no place nicely. 

When you download, you will want to say yes to installing libraries alongside.

## Final Thoughts

If this was bootcamp was interesting to do, we recommend checking out electrical engineering. There are also some robotics classes that have similar or complimentary curriculum, including:

- Embedded Systems 
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- Circuits I and II
